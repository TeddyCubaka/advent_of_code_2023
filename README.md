# AdventOfCode (`AOC`) 2023

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## why did I participate in the event OAC ?

The `reason` is simple, I love challenge. The only moment that I feel i'm alive is when I resolve a problem, generaly in math or in programming.

So, in fact that `AOC` is an advent calendar of puzzles (which are problem to solve), I just got one choice. **participate to the event**. That helps me grow my programming skills.

> Not that if you are a programmer you solve more algoithme to be strong in problem solving.

`I did not mention it but this event star on 1st december and end on 25th december, every years sins 2015.`
